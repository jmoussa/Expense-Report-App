# Expense Report Web App
## A personal project that I outfitted to also use for my database administration class

ReactJS, NodeJS/Express, MySQL

Mainly used to learn ReactJS and Express APIs

Front-end was made with create-react-app, back-end uses a basic Express API.

### Client
This holds the front end data and forms that are used to communicate with the node server. The Output tab shows visualizations of the inputs and the data within the database. 



To configure/start

```$ npm install```



```$ npm start```

---

### Server
This is the Node/Express REST API. It is very basic and is only used to grab input from the front-end and communicate with the database.



To configure/start

```$ npm install```



```$ npm start```

### Schema/001.sql
This holds all of the sql statements to setup the database tables.
